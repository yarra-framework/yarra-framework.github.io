      <description>A new version of the Yarra Client Package has been released (version 0.54). This version offers improved support for the scanner software XA11A and XA11B.
Starting with version XA11A, Siemens has changed the Windows security policies such that even the execution of white-listed applications requries entering the password of the administrator account each time. This can be cumbersome when submitting offline-reconstruction tasks. Therefore, we added an alternative mechanism for launching the Yarra ORT client via a menu that opens by right-clicking on the Yarra icon.</description>
