      <description>A new version of the Yarra Client Tools (YCT) has been released (version 0.5).
This version adds support for anonymizing Twix files from XA30 and XA31. Moreover, the yct_getseqparams tool now offers an &amp;ldquo;indexing&amp;rdquo; function that collects parameters from all Twix files in a folder (and its subfolders) and creates a summary CSV file. This can be helpful for identifying protocol inconsistencies within collections of raw-data files or for ensuring that all raw-data files have been saved with adjustment data.</description>

      <description>A new version of the Yarra Client Package has been released (version 0.54). This version offers improved support for the scanner software XA11A and XA11B.
Starting with version XA11A, Siemens has changed the Windows security policies such that even the execution of white-listed applications requries entering the password of the administrator account each time. This can be cumbersome when submitting offline-reconstruction tasks. Therefore, we added an alternative mechanism for launching the Yarra ORT client via a menu that opens by right-clicking on the Yarra icon.</description>
