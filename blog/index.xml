      <title>Migration to Git</title>
      <link>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/gitmigration/</link>

      <guid>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/gitmigration/</guid>
      <description>We are currently migrating our source code repositories from Mercurial to Git. This is necessary because BitBucket, which we are using as provider for hosting the Yarra source code, is ending support for Mercurial. Some of the repositories might be temporarily unavailable during the time of conversion. After the migration, the repositories will have the same name (slug) and same website URLs, but you will need to use Git if you want to checkout the code.</description>

      <title>Upgrade Your WebGUI</title>
      <link>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/upgrade_webgui/</link>

      <guid>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/upgrade_webgui/</guid>
      <description>If you are still running an older version of the Yarra WebGUI, please update it to the latest version (version 0.97). We are soon shutting-down our old internet domain yarra.rocks and by updating the WebGUI to the latest version, you will continue to receive the latest news and update information right into the WebGUI of your YarraServer. In addition, the latest version of the server package also provides the much-needed resume functionality for tasks that failed during post-processing or transfer steps (so that the reconstruction does not need to be performed again).</description>

      <description>A new version of the client package has been released (version 0.55) that now also supports the Siemens software version VE11S. Moreover, the SAC client now allows sending additional files along with the task, enabling to send, e.g., separate calibration data to the reconstruction module.
The version is now available in the Download section.</description>

      <title>Matlab GRASP Module</title>
      <link>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/matlab_grasp/</link>

      <guid>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/matlab_grasp/</guid>
      <description>A new Matlab-based public version of the GRASP reconstruction algorithm has been released, which integrates into the Yarra offline-reconstruction pipeline. The module has been parallelized using Matlab&amp;rsquo;s Parallel Computation Toolbox and achieves reconstruction speed in the same magnitude as our C++ implementation of the algorithm.
The algorithm can be downloaded on the User Modules page. Please note that Matlab R2016a or newer is required.
The required pulse sequence for GRASP scans, known as &amp;ldquo;RAVE&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Radial-VIBE&amp;rdquo; sequence, can be obtained from us after filing a C2P agreement with Siemens.</description>

      <description>The Yarra Client Tools (YCT) are now available for download. Yarra Client Tools are small command-line tools that help with processing Siemens Twix files. They provide functions for batch anonymization, protocol extraction, and for displaying individual scan parameters. The package should be extracted into the installation folder of the Yarra Client package.
The version is now available in the Download section.</description>

      <title>Client Package 0.54</title>
      <link>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/client_054/</link>

      <description>A new version of the Yarra Client Package has been released (version 0.54). This version offers improved support for the scanner software XA11A and XA11B.
Starting with version XA11A, Siemens has changed the Windows security policies such that even the execution of white-listed applications requries entering the password of the administrator account each time. This can be cumbersome when submitting offline-reconstruction tasks. Therefore, we added an alternative mechanism for launching the Yarra ORT client via a menu that opens by right-clicking on the Yarra icon.</description>

      <title>End of support for Ubuntu Version 12.04 and 14.04</title>
      <link>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/end-of-1204/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://yarra-framework.org/blog/end-of-1204/</guid>
      <description>We decided to end the support We decided to end the support of the Ubuntu version 12.04 LTS and 14.04 LTS. These two versions have now reached the end-of-life date and will not receive security updates anymore. Moreover, there are library incompatibilities that would require us to provide separate binaries. The configuration steps have also changed due to Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s migration from Upstart to systemd. Therefore, we decided to drop support for these outdated Ubuntu versions and we encourage all users to upgrade their servers to either Ubuntu 16.</description>

      <description>We finally managed to create a new website for the Yarra framework and hope to provide more up-to-date information on Yarra going forward. Currently, we are still in the process of migrating some remaining content from our old website, but this should be completed soon.
For reference, the old website is still available under this link. Note, however, that the old website will not be updated anymore, so that the information provided there can be outdated.</description>
